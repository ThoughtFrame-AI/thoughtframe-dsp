  <h1 class="fw-bold mb-3">Frames & Interpretation</h1>

  <p class="lead text-muted" style="max-width: 900px;">
    Frames are the interpretation layer that consumes acoustic windows and
    events produced by the Python runtime. They exist outside the signal
    processing system and operate exclusively on persisted evidence, not
    raw audio streams.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mb-5">
  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">Separation of Concerns</h2>

  <p>
    The acoustic runtime is intentionally limited to evidence production.
    It does not assign meaning, intent, or consequence to detected activity.
    Frames exist to handle those responsibilities separately.
  </p>

  <p>
    This separation enforces a hard boundary:
  </p>

  <ul class="ms-3">
    <li>The Python system measures and segments</li>
    <li>Frames interpret and reason</li>
    <li>Humans remain authoritative over conclusions</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-3">
    By design, interpretation can evolve without invalidating previously
    captured evidence.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mb-5">
  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">What a Frame Represents</h2>

  <p>
    In this context, a Frame represents a stateful workspace focused on one
    or more acoustic events. A Frame may span:
  </p>

  <ul class="ms-3">
    <li>A single window</li>
    <li>A sequence of related windows</li>
    <li>A hypothesis that evolves over time</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-3">
    Frames accumulate context as new evidence arrives, allowing interpretations
    to be revised rather than replaced.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mb-5">
  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">Evidence Consumption</h2>

  <p>
    Frames ingest structured window records rather than live streams. Each
    record includes precise timing, aggregate statistics, and optional audio
    references.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because evidence is immutable once written, Frames can:
  </p>

  <ul class="ms-3">
    <li>Replay historical events</li>
    <li>Compare interpretations across runs</li>
    <li>Apply new reasoning logic to old data</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-3">
    This decoupling is essential for auditability and long-term analysis.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mb-5">
  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">Human-in-the-Loop by Design</h2>

  <p>
    Frames are designed to support human review, not replace it. Analysts
    interact with Frames by:
  </p>

  <ul class="ms-3">
    <li>Reviewing window statistics and timelines</li>
    <li>Listening to associated audio segments</li>
    <li>Annotating, tagging, or rejecting interpretations</li>
    <li>Recording confidence or uncertainty</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-3">
    Human conclusions are layered on top of evidence rather than overwriting
    it. Disagreement and revision are first-class outcomes.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mb-5">
  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">State and Temporal Reasoning</h2>

  <p>
    Frames maintain state across time. Rather than producing isolated
    classifications, they track how interpretations change as additional
    evidence arrives.
  </p>

  <p>
    This enables reasoning patterns such as:
  </p>

  <ul class="ms-3">
    <li>Escalation from weak signals to strong hypotheses</li>
    <li>Decay or dismissal of unsupported interpretations</li>
    <li>Correlation across multiple events or sensors</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-3">
    State is explicit and inspectable, avoiding hidden model memory.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mb-5">
  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">Multiple Interpretations</h2>

  <p>
    Because Frames do not modify underlying evidence, multiple interpretations
    may coexist. Different Frames may analyze the same windows using different
    assumptions, policies, or levels of confidence.
  </p>

  <p>
    This allows the system to support:
  </p>

  <ul class="ms-3">
    <li>Parallel analytic workflows</li>
    <li>Training and evaluation scenarios</li>
    <li>Post-hoc analysis with updated criteria</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="mb-5">
  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">Boundary to Action</h2>

  <p>
    Frames may inform downstream actions — alerts, reports, or integrations —
    but they do not directly control the acoustic runtime.
  </p>

  <p>
    Any action taken is traceable back to:
  </p>

  <ul class="ms-3">
    <li>The original signal</li>
    <li>The windowed evidence</li>
    <li>The Frame state at the time of decision</li>
    <li>Human input, if present</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">Why This Matters</h2>

  <p>
    By separating evidence production from interpretation, the system remains
    adaptable without becoming opaque. Frames allow reasoning to evolve while
    preserving the integrity of the underlying signal record.
  </p>

  <p>
    This design is critical in real-time sensing environments where trust,
    accountability, and hindsight matter as much as responsiveness.
