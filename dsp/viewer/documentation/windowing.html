  <p class="lead text-muted" style="max-width: 900px;">
    Windowing is the mechanism by which continuous acoustic streams are
    transformed into discrete, reviewable units of evidence. Rather than
    attempting to classify individual samples or chunks in isolation,
    the system reasons over time-bounded windows with explicit lifecycles.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mb-5">
  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">Why Windowing Exists</h2>

  <p>
    Raw acoustic data is unbounded. Even per-chunk features are too granular
    to support meaningful interpretation or human review. Windowing exists
    to impose structure on time without losing continuity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of asking “what is this chunk?”, the system asks:
  </p>

  <p class="fw-semibold">
    <em>“Over this span of time, what happened, and how did it evolve?”</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    This shift is essential for real-world sensing, where events have duration,
    onset, decay, and internal variation.
  </p>

  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">Window Isolators</h2>

  <p>
    Windowing is implemented by specialized processors called
    <code>WindowIsolators</code>. These processors observe the stream of
    chunk-level measurements and propose transitions between window states.
  </p>

  <p>
    A window isolator:
  </p>

  <ul class="ms-3">
    <li>Maintains internal state across chunks</li>
    <li>Defines explicit rules for window boundaries</li>
    <li>Accumulates aggregate statistics over time</li>
    <li>Persists completed windows as durable records</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-3">
    Importantly, isolators do not infer meaning. They segment time according
    to explicit, inspectable logic.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mb-5">
  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">Window Lifecycle</h2>

  <p>
    Every window follows a well-defined lifecycle:
  </p>

  <ul class="ms-3">
    <li><strong>Start</strong> – a new window is opened at a specific time and chunk</li>
    <li><strong>Accumulate</strong> – statistics are updated as chunks arrive</li>
    <li><strong>Close</strong> – the window is finalized based on explicit criteria</li>
    <li><strong>Persist</strong> – aggregated results are written to disk</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-3">
    Lifecycle boundaries are explicit and deterministic. Short or spurious
    windows may be discarded using minimum duration rules to suppress noise.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mb-5">
  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">Base Window Schema</h2>

  <p>
    All windows share a canonical schema, ensuring consistency across
    isolators and pipelines. This schema includes:
  </p>

  <ul class="ms-3">
    <li>Unique window identifier</li>
    <li>Start and end times</li>
    <li>Start and end chunk indices</li>
    <li>Duration in seconds and chunks</li>
    <li>Number of contributing chunks</li>
    <li>Aggregate acoustic statistics (mean, variance, min, max)</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-3">
    Individual isolators may extend this schema with additional fields, but
    the base lifecycle and timing fields are fixed.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mb-5">
  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">From Windows to Events</h2>

  <p>
    A completed window represents a candidate <em>event</em>. At this layer,
    an event is not a semantic label or classification — it is a bounded
    region of time with measurable properties.
  </p>

  <p>
    Events are therefore:
  </p>

  <ul class="ms-3">
    <li>Time-bounded</li>
    <li>Replayable</li>
    <li>Comparable across runs</li>
    <li>Independent of interpretation</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-3">
    This definition allows events to be reinterpreted later as new context,
    models, or human insight becomes available.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mb-5">
  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">Multiple Windowing Strategies</h2>

  <p>
    Different isolators may be used simultaneously within a pipeline, each
    capturing different temporal phenomena. For example:
  </p>

  <ul class="ms-3">
    <li>Fixed-duration windows for baseline statistics</li>
    <li>Novelty-driven windows for anomalous activity</li>
    <li>Impulse windows for transient signals</li>
    <li>Contextual windows spanning elevated activity</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-3">
    Because windows are independent and persisted, overlapping or parallel
    interpretations do not conflict.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="mb-5">
  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">Persistence and Review</h2>

  <p>
    Completed windows are written immediately as structured records, typically
    in CSV form. This persistence layer is not optional or best-effort — it is
    part of the windowing contract.
  </p>

  <p>
    Persisted windows enable:
  </p>

  <ul class="ms-3">
    <li>Offline analysis and visualization</li>
    <li>Human review and annotation</li>
    <li>Cross-run comparison</li>
    <li>Reprocessing without raw audio</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">Why Windows Matter</h2>

  <p>
    Windowing is the bridge between continuous sensing and structured reasoning.
    It allows the system to operate indefinitely while still producing discrete,
    trustworthy units of evidence.
  </p>

  <p>
    By making window boundaries explicit and inspectable, the system avoids the
    ambiguity and irreproducibility common in end-to-end streaming models.
