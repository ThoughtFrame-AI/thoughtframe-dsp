  <p class="lead text-muted" style="max-width: 900px;">
    This project is a real-time acoustic processing and interpretation system
    built as a <strong>field-level proof of concept</strong> for ThoughtFrame.
    It demonstrates how deterministic pipelines, explicit time semantics, and
    stateful <em>Frames</em> can operate on continuous physical signals —
    not documents, prompts, or static datasets.

  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">Why This Exists</h2>

  <p>
    Most AI systems are designed for static worlds: a document goes in, an answer
    comes out. Real-world sensing does not work that way. Acoustic systems operate
    continuously, under noise, latency, and uncertainty, with no opportunity to
    “retry” a missed event.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project exists to answer a simple question:
  </p>

  <p class="fw-semibold">
    <em>Can ThoughtFrame reason about the physical world in real time, without
    sacrificing determinism, auditability, or human control?</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    The answer, demonstrated here, is yes — by cleanly separating
    <strong>signal processing</strong> from <strong>interpretation</strong>,
    and by treating time, state, and evidence as first-class concepts.

  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">System Philosophy</h2>

  <ul class="ms-3">
    <li><strong>DSP never decides.</strong> It produces measurements, features, and candidate events.</li>
    <li><strong>ThoughtFrame never guesses.</strong> Interpretation is explicit, stateful, and replayable.</li>
    <li><strong>Humans remain authoritative.</strong> The system is built for review, disagreement, and revision.</li>
    <li><strong>Time is real.</strong> Every decision is anchored to clocks, windows, and duration.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-3">
    This architecture avoids the common failure modes of end-to-end ML systems:
    opaque decisions, irreproducible behavior, and loss of context over time.

  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">High-Level Architecture</h2>

  <p>
    The system is intentionally split into two layers:

  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">What This Is (and Is Not)</h2>

  <ul class="ms-3">
    <li>This is <strong>not</strong> an autonomous detection or targeting system.</li>
    <li>This is <strong>not</strong> a black-box ML classifier.</li>
    <li>This is <strong>not</strong> a dashboard that forgets the past.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-3">
    It <strong>is</strong> a system for producing trustworthy, replayable
    acoustic evidence and reasoning over it safely — whether the application
    is sonar analysis, industrial monitoring, environmental sensing, or any
    other domain where signals unfold in time.

  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">Why This Matters for ThoughtFrame</h2>

  <p>
    This project proves that ThoughtFrame is not limited to text or chat-based AI.
    The same architectural primitives — deterministic state machines, durable
    memory, explicit boundaries between computation and interpretation — apply
    just as well to the physical world.
  </p>

  <p>
    If ThoughtFrame can operate here, under real clocks and noisy sensors,
    it can operate anywhere.
